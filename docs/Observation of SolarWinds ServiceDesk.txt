1) The API Request and Response payloads are in JSON or XML format. ConnectALL can use JOLT Transformation to handle payloads. 
------> No Risk


2) It uses token based authentication.
	eg: X-Samanage-Authorization: Bearer asdfnaospdifa;sikofaodfasfaf
-----> No Risk


3) The date format is ISO8601 format. We can query date and hour time only. Meaning in UA we should use current time in the url instead of last modified time.
	i.e: 2022-11-09T13
-----> Risk


4) Metadata:
	A) It has no project scope 

	B) It has issue type scope like ServiceDesk
		i) Incidents
		ii) Problems 
		iii) Changes
		iv) Change Catalog
		v) Releases
		vi) Solutions
		vii) Service Catalog
		viii) Configuration Management (CMDB).
-----> No risk


i) To create incident; name is enough
ii) To create problem: name and requester is needed and for updating problem: name is enough
iii) To create change: name, requester and priority is needed and updating change: name is enough
iv) To create change catalog: name is enough
v) To create release: name and requester is needed
vi) To create solution: name and description is needed and for updating solution: name is enough
vii) To create catalog item: name, description and category is needed and for updating catalog item: name is enough
viii) To create configuration item: name is enough


5) Because of API Limitation we cannot do Flow filter
-----> Risk


6) Comments is doable for this UA


7) API Configuration:
	i) Query Modified Records: ${Service Desk}.json?query=updated_at:${current-time}
	ii) Read Record By ID: ${Service Desk}/${recordId}.json
	iii) Create Record: ${Service Desk}.json
	iv) Update Record: ${Service Desk}/${recordId}.json
	v) Retrieve Comments: ${Service Desk}/${recordId}/comments.json
	vi) Save Comment: ${Service Desk}/${recordId}/comments.json


8) Needed to execute a query in the muledb to increase the token character size.
sql server:  alter table fav_connection_login_options alter column val varchar(4000);
mysql: USE muledb;
		ALTER TABLE fav_connection_login_options 
		MODIFY COLUMN val varchar(4000);


9) There are standard fields published in the documentation. 
	i) In jira, during value mapping for status: To Do can only be mapped to New state of SolarWinds
